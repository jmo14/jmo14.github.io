Your “clock” doesn’t need to resemble a traditional clock, and may instead employ other functions that are triggered by these events.

In teams of two (+), students will work together to create and execute an interactive design tool that employs API linking with IFTTT (If This Then That). Teams must also design and develop a website that serves to promote this tool and document its real-life application and usage.
